## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Neon green (#00FF88) to highlight key interactive elements and calls to action, reflecting an edgy, technological, and exciting educational feel.
- Background color: Dark grey (#0C0C0C) providing a stark contrast to make the neon green pop, which will also reduce eye strain and provide a sophisticated feel.
- Accent color: Light Green (#98FF98), slightly desaturated and brighter than the primary color, for secondary highlights and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif, for headlines and shorter body text; consider 'Inter', sans-serif, for longer body text sections; prioritize legibility in both Arabic and English.
- Use simple, neon-green icons to represent different features and categories; ensure icons are understandable in both Arabic and English contexts.
- Implement a tab-based navigation for Home, Chat, My Books, and Settings. Use glassmorphism cards with soft shadows and rounded corners to present information.
- Add subtle hover glow effects on buttons and motion transitions for a modern feel.
